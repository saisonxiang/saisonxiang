- I’m currently working on computational engineering topics, art and entertainment, simple webpage design with HTML/CSS, MacOS operations research, open source writing, practice for profit business proposals, independent game development, applied chaos theory, spiritual/religious research, Chinese/Japanese/Korean language and cultural research, IRL streaming, online community writing, unicode emoji collection and utilization, robot building, music production and distribution, and coding research (computational as well as street).

- My goal is to live life to the fullest and continue on the path I've found myself following for the last 5 years.



⊂(◉‿◉)つ
- I enjoy developing my ideas in virtual reality. Discord and Twitch are very powerful social networking applications.



(◕◕✿)ORLY 
- I also code HTML and CSS for my GitHub.io Business Website.



☆(^o^)乂(^-^)☆ 
- I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of things. If you have a pitch, pass it this way and I will at least give you the professional courtesy of constructive criticism even if I'm not interested.

- I always look for independent entrepreneurs (small Twitch streamers are so cool) to co-work/study virtually. It helps to be a Japanese/Chinese/Korean/Vietnamese/Thai barely fluent English speaker. We can languange/cultural exchange while we meditate throughout the work week.

中爆(中國的會爆炸) 
- Language: English. Muy poquito Espanol. Ni-hao. Chotto-matte. I like to virtually submerge in Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Spanish and just listen to it like music. I also dabble in AI-English and made up copy-paste languages/code games.
