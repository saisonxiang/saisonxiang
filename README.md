### ㅇㅅㅇ oh henlo dere, I'm IKE 👋



Here are a few things about me to get started:


ᕙ༼◕◕༽ᕤ 
- `I’m currently working on computational engineering topics, art and entertainment, simple webpage design with HTML/CSS, MacOS operations research, open source writing, practice for profit business proposals, independent game development, applied chaos theory, spiritual/religious research, Chinese/Japanese/Korean language and cultural research, IRL streaming, online community writing, unicode emoji collection and utilization, robot building, music production and distribution, and coding research (computational as well as street).`



(ﾉ≧∇≦)ﾉ ﾐ ┻━┻ 
- `My goal is to live life to the fullest and continue on the path I've found myself following for the last 5 years.`



⊂(◉‿◉)つ
- `I enjoy developing my ideas in virtual reality. Discord and Twitch are very powerful social networking applications.`



(◕◕✿)ORLY 
- `I also code HTML and CSS for my GitHub.io Business Website.`



☆(^o^)乂(^-^)☆ 
- `I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of things. If you have a pitch, pass it this way and I will at least give you the professional courtesy of constructive criticism even if I'm not interested.`



☆(^o^)乂(^-^)☆ 
- `I always look for independent entrepreneurs (small Twitch streamers are so cool) to co-work/study virtually. It helps to be a Japanese/Chinese/Korean/Vietnamese/Thai barely fluent English speaker. We can languange/cultural exchange while we meditate throughout the work week.`



ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ 
- `Pronouns: He/him/teddy`



巴 
- `Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, node.js/discord.js/JavaScript`



中爆(中國的會爆炸) 
- `Language: English. Muy poquito Espanol. Ni-hao. Chotto-matte. I like to virtually submerge in Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Spanish and just listen to it like music. I also dabble in AI-English and made up copy-paste languages/code games.`
